# Dashboard

This repository contains up-to-date materials related to my GSoC application.

The project I'm applying is [App Store-like Plugin Manager](https://musescore.org/en/handbook/developers-handbook/google-summer-code/gsoc-ideas-2019#plugin-manager). Briefly speaking, it would be a new plugin manager in MuseScore, from which it is possible to discover, (un-)install, (auto-)update plugins in an easy manner.
